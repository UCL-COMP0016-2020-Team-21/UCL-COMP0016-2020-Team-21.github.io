Meeting with Client 

Our team arranged a meeting in advance, and we met our client from NTT Data on Thursday (22 Oct 2020) using Microsoft
Teams. We were given a brief introduction on the background of the company and we had a chat with our client to understand
the requirements of our project. For our team, we were supposed to build an Augmented Reality (AR) application which
demonstrates the procedure of MRI scan. Our client suggested several other surgical procedures to be included in the
application as well. One of the key requirements is for us to include an MRI scanning machine and some educational
games related to the scan in the application. After discussing in detailed, we were able to identify the main users
of our application as well as some key features that should be included in our application. We also created a channel
between us and our client to ensure smooth communication throughout the project (which includes meeting the client every
two weeks). At the end of the meeting, we were able to get a rough idea of our application and were ready to get started
on the project.
