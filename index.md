# Week 3 (19 Oct 2020 - 25 Oct 2020)

Meeting with Client 

Our team arranged a meeting in advance, and we met our client from NTT Data on Thursday (22 Oct 2020) using Microsoft
Teams. We were given a brief introduction on the background of the company and we had a chat with our client to understand
the requirements of our project. For our team, we were supposed to build an Augmented Reality (AR) application which
demonstrates the procedure of MRI scan. Our client suggested several other surgical procedures to be included in the
application as well. One of the key requirements is for us to include an MRI scanning machine and some educational
games related to the scan in the application. After discussing in detailed, we were able to identify the main users
of our application as well as some key features that should be included in our application. We also created a channel
between us and our client to ensure smooth communication throughout the project (which includes meeting the client every
two weeks). At the end of the meeting, we were able to get a rough idea of our application and were ready to get started
on the project. 



# Week 4 (26 Oct 2020 – 1 Nov 2020)  

Content: Users and Personas 

To identify the user’s requirements, we came up with a series of questions. We decided to use a questionnaire with open questions for our pseudo users. This approach allows the users to express their thoughts and make suggestions from their perspective. After identifying the key users of our application, we came up with some personas to represent these users. We created 2 personas, an adult user who is about to go for an MRI scan and the other persona is a child user who is either about to go for an MRI scan, or waiting for his/her parent(s) who is undergoing an MRI scan. The child user can use this app while waiting for the scan to finish, whereas for the adult user, the user uses the app to understand the procedure of the scan and some precautions to take before the scan. We analyzed the behaviors of these users and used a Likert Scale to represent these data. We also listed the motivations and pain points of these users as this information will be used as a reference to decide our overall design of our application and improvise our application. 



# Week 5 (2 Nov 2020 – 8 Nov 2020) 

Content: Gathering User Requirements and Prototyping 

To visualize our application, we came up with 2 sketches to display the different layouts of our application. After some discussion, we decided that our sketch 2 has a simpler and clearer UI, so we created a prototype using Figma based on our second sketch. We presented our prototype to our client and we received some feedback. We decided to create another prototype which was more AR based (as compared to our previous prototype) using the suggestions given as well as from some online resources. After completing the prototype, we presented our latest prototype to our users and received additional feedback from them. Within our group, we also carried out a heuristic evaluation to improve our prototype. Combining the feedback from users and the result of our evaluation, we improved our second prototype by iterating the process and accomplished our final prototype before moving on to the process of implementation. 



# Week 7 (16 Nov 2020 – 22 Nov 2020) 

Content: Getting Started 

After we finished our HCI part of the project, our next step was to implement our application using Unity as suggested by our client. As all our members do not have any prior experience with Unity, we had to follow online tutorials in order to get started. Other than that, we also followed some C# tutorials as the programming language used in Unity is C#. For this week, our main goal was to finish the tutorials as well as go through the resources given by our TA to familiarize ourselves with Unity and the C# programming language.  



# Week 8 (23 Nov 2020 – 29 Nov 2020) 

Content: Main Task and Updates with Client 

During our lab session with our TA, we discussed about some issues regarding Unity as both of our members had some problems with our Unity license. Our TA provided extra resources to us as some of our members were having a hard time to implement the application in Unity. On Thursday, we met up with our client to update our progress as well to clarify some confusions regarding the project. Our client provided an example to help us to understand the application that we were supposed to implement. After the meeting, we came up with a MoSCoW list to order our tasks according to their priority. For this week, our aim is to create a basic application with an MRI machine and a practitioner before we implement the other parts of our application.  



# Week 9 (30 Nov 2020 – 6 Nov 2020) 

Content: Problems Faced During Implementation 

After we divided the tasks amongst our group members, each of us started to work on our individual task. We created a project and used Unity Collab to work together. We managed to find the model for the MRI machine but not the practitioner as the model for the practitioner was not free. As a result, we decided to turn to our client for help. We left a message for our client in Microsoft Teams and he promised to help us to find the model for the practitioner.  



# Week 10 (7 Nov 2020 – 13 Nov 2020) 

Content: Progress of First Implementation 

As we created our MRI Room, our MRI room was slightly different from the example given by our client. Another problem faced by our member was a build problem in Unity. Our team member arranged a separate meeting with the TA to discuss on how to solve this issue. Other than that, our client has not gotten back to us about the practitioner, so we planned to discuss about this issue with him during our scheduled meeting on Thursday. Unfortunately, our client was having a leave on Thursday, and he requested to postpone the meeting to next week, so we were not able to meet up with him this week. Thus, we rescheduled the meeting and sent an email to follow up on our practitioner model.
